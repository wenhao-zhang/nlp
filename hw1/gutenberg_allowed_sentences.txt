All looked up to them .
I only doubt whether he will ever take us anywhere else .
Oh no !
Oh dear , no !
That will be a much better thing .
And yet she was a happy woman , and a woman whom no one named without good - will .
Two such she did not want .
He could sing a little himself .
She was in no hurry at all .
The next question was --
not handsome -- not at all handsome .
One does not , you know , after a time .
But did you never see him ?
Oh yes !
Yes .
What do you think of him ?
She , therefore , said no more for some time .
He seems to me to be grown particularly gentle of late .
say beautiful rather .
oh !
It was not lost on me .
Exactly so .
certainly not too tall ; not in the least too tall .
I cannot keep my eyes from it .
It is so with some men .
But what shall I say ?
Are you in any doubt as to that ?
I will have nothing to do with it .
yes , very .
But how shall I do ?
how so ?
Will that do ?
She is pretty , and she is good tempered , and that is all .
What !
If she has it now , you have given it .
I know him well .
Oh !
But ah !
All the better .
Ah !
and very much to the purpose .
Do help me .
I never saw any thing so hard .
Is it kingdom ?
Do you think it is a good one ?
Oh , no !
It must be very clever , or he would not have brought it .
She could not speak .
It was enough for her to feel .
I thought it must be so .
I am very happy .
When I look back to the first time I saw him !
And how beautiful we thought he looked !
You understand every thing .
You do nothing .
Your dear mother was so clever at all those things !
--
I cannot really change for the better .
but what shall you do ?
He had been going to call on them .
It must , if I were not here .
But it would not do ; he had not come to the point .
no -- none in the least .
I thought it very well done of him indeed .
But how sad it is that he should not live at home with his father !
She thought it was time to make up .
I suppose there is not a man in such practice anywhere .
What will it answer ?
.
He said no more .
I am very much afraid that it will all end in nothing .
But at present there was nothing more to be said .
I am sorry for it .
I am not at all afraid .
He did not know what they had best do .
It really was so .
You have made yourself too clear .
I have thought only of you .
There I was quite right .
she found something else must be done .
here it is .
It is such a blessing !
You are very kind .
Yes , next week .
But they always do , you know .
But you see , every thing turns out for the best .
no .
Just like her !
The evil day was put off .
He had time only to say ,
He seemed to me very well off as he was .
Thank you , we do indeed .
only think .
I did not know what to do .
dear ; I was so miserable !
dear , I thought it would have been the death of me !
Of course , he must be sorry to lose her -- they must be all sorry .
It was a bad business .
go to - day , go to - day .
What is right to be done cannot be done too soon .
The son looked convinced .
He was immediately interested .
Do not let me lose it .
But we never did .
had been a question of his .
But you will do every thing right .
I need not tell you what is to be done .
I know what worthy people they are .
said she .
He started .
I am sure he has not the least idea of it .
Do not put it into his head .
I have heard him say that he could listen to her for ever .
She could see nothing but evil in it .
I am sure I had much rather hear you .
I should be quite in the way .
but indeed I would much rather have it only in one .
I never shall forget his manner .
That , you know , was so very .
Oh , said I , my dear , I did say as much as I could .
He would be so very .
There , it is done .
I would have her understand me .
I dare say he will come in when he knows who is here .
We were just in time ; my mother just ready for us .
How is she to - day ?
But do come in .
I could not stay two minutes .
do come in .
You said you had a great many , and now you have not one left .
You should not have done it , indeed you should not .
he is off .
You must have heard every thing to be sure .
So you would all .
Do not tell his father , but that young man is not quite the thing .
It is his own idea .
This is what we all feel .
no -- a very bad plan .
I never heard of such a thing .
I never could have supposed it .
There is no hurry at all .
That is a great thing .
I doubt it .
I shall never forget it .
Look !
What was to be done ?
They are not far off .
Shall I call upon them ?
She will not even listen to your questions .
We are growing a little too nice .
No , the young lady , to be sure .
And away he ran .
He felt the going away almost too much to speak of it .
I am sure we do .
I am sure you did not much expect to like us .
It was a right thing to do .
She heard him sigh .
It was a sad change .
Well !
So much the better .
It was all my doing , I know .
She did not really like her .
I could do very well without it .
Will not it be a good plan ?
I like him very much .
She speaks a little too quick .
Though I think he had better not have married .
We must bring her forward .
I am sure she does .
I like her the better for it .
You and I need not be afraid .
I have no idea of that sort of thing .
In a moment he went on --
What I said just now , meant nothing .
Now do not you feel that you had ?
Yes , I am sure you are much too reasonable .
They will stay a good while when they do come , and he will be half his time with us .
She was happy , she knew she was happy , and knew she ought to be happy .
I do indeed .
Now will be the time .
I think it is so .
He would be always coming over .
He was on the move immediately ; but coming back , said ,
` Oh !
Very happy to hear it .
there he is .
You will excuse me .
She would not look again .
Sir , you are most kind .
no , there is but one .
I was convinced there were two , and there is but one .
I do not know .
In one moment such a change !
just behind .
They were entering the hall .
It used to stand here .
Where is it ?
It is time for us to be going indeed .
leave all that to me .
Nothing can be more simple , you see .
I am tired of doing nothing .
I want a change .
Go and eat and drink a little more , and you will do very well .
But you were humble .
You order me , whether you speak or not .
And you can be always with me .
Let every body on the Hill hear me if they can .
I will not say quite all .
That will just do for me , you know .
I will do my best .
We have nothing clever to say -- not one of us .
An old married man -- quite good for nothing .
Will you ?
I am in no hurry .
With all my heart .
I am quite ready .
He looked around , as if to see that no one were near , and then said ,
It was not so very bad .
She felt it at her heart .
But it should be so no more .
It was felt as such things must be felt .
She was sorry , very sorry .
This moment , if you please .
You will know it all in time .
I know it has .
You will not see him .
I shall leave you together .
Do not let mine continue longer .
But it is even so .
Did you ever hear any thing so strange ?
I met him just now .
I never could have an idea of any body else -- and so I thought you knew .
No !
He was coming through the hall .
was not that her own doing too ?
Nothing should separate her from her father .
I am always well , you know .
In half a minute they were together .
He must do it all himself .
said he .
We seemed to understand each other .
I cannot doubt it .
You have not heard all that you ought to hear .
But she was always right .
But that would not do .
By doing it , I shall feel that I am near you .
-- What does this mean ?
I shall soon have done .
Come , he knows himself there .
And now , let me talk to you of something else .
she is a sweet creature !
And then not to find him at home !
Let us forgive each other at once .
as to all that , of course nothing can be thought of yet .
You must have done well .
I am very sure you did me good .
He had no idea of me .
It would never do .
But in time they will .
You must have seen that I did .
She was not sorry .
In half a minute they were in the room .
Look at her .
They are to be new set .
Chapter 1
what was his name ?
I shall forget my own name soon , I suppose .
He had always been lucky ; he knew he should be so still .
He said he should not stay out long ; but he has never come back , and now it is almost one .
I went .
said she , when they were ready .
very well done indeed !
Lord bless me !
You would not like to leave him yourself , but you see I can be of no use .
I knew how it would be .
This is always my luck .
I dare say we shall have nothing to distress us .
To be sure , I may just as well go as not , for I am of no use at home -- am I ?
And it was soon over .
She had seen him .
They had met .
They had been once more in the same room .
It was now his object to marry .
Chapter 8
Once so much to each other !
Now nothing !
I knew she would .
it would have been a happy thing , if he had never left you .
This brought his sister upon him .
Thank God !
Yes , indeed , oh yes !
Once , too , he spoke to her .
She could not even thank him .
She could not stay .
no , indeed !
But this , no doubt , you have been always doing .
Yes ; he had done it .
I do not like having such things so long in hand .
I really think they ought .
I was sure that would come out , if it was so .
It is bad for him , I know , to be shut up as he is ; but what can we do ?
that I had not given way to her at the fatal moment !
She could not stand it .
But now , do not stand upon ceremony .
A good place is not it ?
oh Lord !
I do not know what he would be at .
But this was not all which they had to make them happy .
They did not know .
and so late !
They could think of no one else .
You must not run away from us now .
But everything must take its chance .
Will it make you happy ?
How could it be ?
At last , it became necessary to speak of her .
She was not sorry for the excuse .
I am sure I had not .
I do not understand it .
Does she never mean to go away ?
Let me know what you think of this .
I think not .
is it you ?
Thank you , thank you .
Do look at it .
Did you ever see the like ?
Lord !
I shall not stop .
But first of all , you must tell me the name of the young lady I am going to talk about .
for himself .
said he at last .
He spoke to her , and then turned away .
being all that she had time for , as she passed away .
no , that is clear enough .
He might be only passing through .
How would it all be ?
Of course they must attend .
I see you know nothing of the matter .
How so ?
The first act was over .
She saw him not far off .
She felt that something must be the matter .
Why was it ?
She felt a great deal of good - will towards him .
I need not ask after her .
I can understand .
She could say nothing .
But why should you be cruel ?
And , upon my word , he is nothing to me .
Then do tell me what he was at that time of life .
At last --
I will only tell you what I have found him .
It must have been about the same time that he became known to my father and sister .
I found he had been used to hear of me .
He is worse than last year .
But it shows you the man .
This will not do .
But this was a vain idea .
And you may say , that I mean to call upon her soon .
Who could it be ?
But then , it had been taken up by his father and mother .
yes .
She never did , you know .
I am sure she would rather not come ; she cannot feel easy with us .
Who is it ?
Come , and tell me .
You will be too late if you do not make haste .
how can you think of such a thing ?
dear !
I little thought then -- but no matter .
I am not sorry , indeed , to make it over to another .
We certainly do not forget you as soon as you forget us .
I know you will not be sorry to be off .
He had passed out of the room without a look !
Have you not seen this ?
But I am afraid ; and I should be so very sorry .
This was almost cruel .
You were single .
My own self .
I did not understand you .
Chapter 24
It would be enough to make them completely easy .
beyond anything great !
It will certainly be much the best way .
Five hundred a year !
At present , I know him so well , that I think him really handsome ; or at least , almost so .
Like him !
They heard her with surprise .
Are you , indeed , going there ?
It must be so .
They set off .
to be sure I do .
is this just ?
But I see what you mean .
But it will not do .
When he was present she had no eyes for any one else .
Every thing he did , was right .
Every thing he said , was clever .
This was too much .
I am almost sure it is , for I saw him cut it off .
What a blow upon them all was this !
said almost every body .
His setting off in such a hurry seems very like it .
No .
It seems but the work of a moment .
What can it be ?
But why ?
Look at those hills !
You may see the end of the house .
What am I to tell you ?
I have brought my other son and daughter to see you .
She got up to examine them .
dear , how beautiful these are !
You must come , indeed .
We do not live a great way from him in the country , you know .
You cannot think how happy I shall be !
I am sure you will like it of all things .
This is always the way with him !
Nothing can be like it , to be sure !
How can you be so cross as not to come ?
Where did he live ?
How could you suppose so ?
But I dare say you will go for all that .
This decided the matter at once .
I was young once , but I never was very handsome -- worse luck for me .
And how does your business go on ?
why does he not look at me ?
how can you talk so ?
But could it be so ?
I know he did .
nothing seems to do her any good .
I am sure if I knew of any thing she would like , I would send all over the town for it .
Did you ever see her ?
yes , that I do indeed .
I have never told you how this was brought on .
But to what does all this lead ?
' Lord !
said I -- I cannot think who you mean .
I understand she is a woman of very good fortune .
I could not have stood it .
But I would not alarm you too much .
She will tell you any thing if you ask .
I have had such a time of it !
I only stood at the door , and heard what I could .
and Lord help ' em !
Yes , yes , I will go and see her , sure enough .
This set the matter beyond a doubt .
What had really passed between them was to this effect .
There are not many men who would act as he has done .
Well , so much the better for him .
I have had no hand in it .
But I thought I would just tell you of this , because I knew how much it must please you .
But now it is all too late .
But it was too late .
I heard it from the servant .
I was miserable .
I could not answer it .
You saw what she said .
It was not forced on you .
You have proved your heart less wicked , much less wicked .
He held out his hand .
And with these words , he almost ran out of the room .
I know we shall be happy .
It has not made him happy .
She looked again .
But so it was .
And they said , So do , as thou hast said .
And he said , I will not do it , if I find thirty there .
And she said , I will go .
And he said , I am .
bless me , even me also , O my father .
And they said , We know him .
And he said to him , Here am I .
And he knew her again no more .
tell me them , I pray you .
And they did so .
Is he yet alive ?
ye have done evil in so doing .
what shall we speak ?
And he said , Here am I .
And he said , I will do as thou hast said .
why is it that ye have left the man ?
I know that he can speak well .
why is it that thou hast sent me ?
they be almost ready to stone me .
And be ye of good courage , and bring of the fruit of the land .
we will not come up .
And he said , Nay .
And he went to an high place .
And all the people shall answer and say , Amen .
And all the people shall say , Amen .
And all that stood by him went out from him .
that thou shalt say , No .
So he died .
And he did so .
go out , I pray now , and fight with them .
is it not so ?
So his strength was not known .
and what hast thou here ?
And she told her all that the man had done to her .
And he said , I called not ; lie down again .
And he said , What is there done , my son ?
and to whom shall he go up from us ?
Now therefore get you up ; for about this time ye shall find him .
bring the men , that we may put them to death .
But he told not his father .
Is there not a cause ?
it is not so .
for what have I done ?
or what evil is in mine hand ?
should it not be with the heads of these men ?
I pray thee , tell me .
And they said , He is dead .
can I bring him back again ?
I shall go to him , but he shall not return to me .
And they went out every man from him .
And he said , Say on .
And the woman said , Let my lord the king now speak .
let me go over , I pray thee , and take off his head .
if not ; speak thou .
And he turned aside , and stood still .
Now therefore why speak ye not a word of bringing the king back ?
And he said , What ye shall say , that will I do for you .
And the king said , I will give them .
therefore he would not drink it .
This is the noise that ye have heard .
And she said , Say on .
And he said , Nay ; but I will die here .
And this said , No ; but the dead is thy son , and the living is my son .
even now .
And they did it the second time .
And he said , Do it the third time .
And they did it the third time .
And he went up , and looked , and said , There is nothing .
And he said , Go again seven times .
And he said , Is he yet alive ?
Then he said , Go ye , bring him .
And then carry him out , and stone him , that he may die .
And one said on this manner , and another said on that manner .
And they two went on .
And they brought it to him .
tell me , what hast thou in the house ?
And when he had called her , she stood in the door .
And she said , It shall be well .
So he called her .
And he put out his hand , and took it .
how shall we do ?
who ?
And he took them .
So the king of Assyria turned back , and stayed not there in the land .
And they brought the king word again .
Therefore he would not drink it .
There was not the like made in any kingdom .
And one spake saying after this manner , and another saying after that manner .
So they brought the king word again .
will they sacrifice ?
will they make an end in a day ?
I will not go in .
it shall be even given thee to the half of the kingdom .
And the king said , Let him come in .
and it shall be done .
What ?
not one .
and shall the rock be removed out of his place ?
No ; but he would put strength in me .
will he always call upon God ?
and where is the place of understanding ?
the glory of his nostrils is terrible .
his teeth are terrible round about .
The Book of Psalms
for ever ?
or who shall stand in his holy place ?
24 : 8 Who is this King of glory ?
Amen , and Amen .
for then would I fly away , and be at rest .
I will seek it yet again .
or
This also I saw , that it was from the hand of God .
for who can tell a man what shall be after him under the sun ?
8 : 1 Who is as the wise man ?
that we may seek him with thee .
Then said I , Here am I ; send me .
for the living to the dead ?
and where will ye leave your glory ?
where are thy wise men ?
I would go through them , I would burn them together .
And he said , What shall I cry ?
have ye not heard ?
Is there a God beside me ?
or to the woman , What hast thou brought forth ?
when I called , was there none to answer ?
let us stand together : who is mine adversary ?
let him come near to me .
and where is the place of my rest ?
will he keep it to the end ?
is not her king in her ?
Be not afraid of them ; for they cannot do evil , neither also is it in them to do good .
when shall it once be ?
therefore we will wait upon thee : for thou hast made all these things .
let it come now .
or , Ah sister !
or , Ah his glory !
for who is like me ?
And he went in in my sight .
And this is the north side .
And this is the east side .
to what end is it for you ?
and he shall say , No .
for he is small .
what is thy country ?
and of what people art thou ?
Why hast thou done this ?
none evil can come upon us .
is there no king in thee ?
Stand , stand , shall they cry ; but none shall look back .
we shall not die .
how long ?
Why ?
and how do ye see it now ?
And I said , No , my lord .
Then he suffered him .
Amen .
Are ye not much better than they ?
or , What shall we drink ?
And they went their way .
for they all had her .
God is not the God of the dead , but of the living .
whose son is he ?
what is it which these witness against thee ?
And they said , What is that to us ?
see thou to that .
I know thee who thou art , the Holy One of God .
And they went out to see what it was that was done .
go and see .
and do ye not remember ?
there is none good but one , that is , God .
answer me .
and another said , Is it I ?
behold how many things they witness against thee .
And the hand of the Lord was with him .
I know thee who thou art ; the Holy One of God .
or look we for another ?
and to what are they like ?
And he suffered them .
Go not from house to house .
bid her therefore that she help me .
but where are the nine ?
and what sign will there be when these things shall come to pass ?
And they said , Nothing .
tell us .
that we may give an answer to them that sent us .
And it was now dark , and Jesus was not come to them .
Why go ye about to kill me ?
even because ye cannot hear my word .
He said , I know not .
And they cast him out .
But Jesus gave him no answer .
knowing that it was the Lord .
follow thou me .
of himself , or of some other man ?
And he said , Behold , I am here , Lord .
And so he did .
I am not he .
Farewell .
are we better than they ?
for the end of those things is death .
8 : 8 So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God .
If God be for us , who can be against us ?
Why do ye not rather take wrong ?
have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord ?
are not ye my work in the Lord ?
What shall I say to you ?
And the rest will I set in order when I come .
for ye shall speak into the air .
I will pray with the spirit , and I will pray with the understanding also : I will sing with the spirit , and I will sing with the understanding also .
and with what body do they come ?
so am I .
forgive me this wrong .
or do I seek to please men ?
if it be yet in vain .
The Lord is at hand .
Are not even ye in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming ?
The Lord be with you all .
But now we see not yet all things put under him .
For what is your life ?
let him pray .
Even so , Amen .
This is the second death .
Even so , come , Lord Jesus .
What shall I call thee ?
do they cry , Do they hear their father sigh ?
No , no !
never can it be !
Never , never can it be !
Am not I A fly like thee ?
Or art not thou A man like me ?
If thought is life And strength and breath And the want Of thought is death ;
Then am I A happy fly , If I live , Or if I die .
What can it mean ?
I
she said .
Then it was very still for a long time .
We want to come in !
she thought .
run !
Of course you could .
That was a pull !
I am almost dead for want of air .
It shut behind him , and he was in a little room .
And what do you think !
And what do you think he did ?
He was pretty tired when he got home .
It was a very hot day .
Come and help !
He was indeed a king worthy of them !
What shall I do ?
he said .
You always speak to me , if everything is all right , when I come home .
Never again did the dear mother have to do any hard work , and she had pretty things about her all the rest of her life .
Now such a story who ever heard ?
What was it that he was , now ?
Why was this glory for him ?
Two of the pretty ladies were with them .
How beautiful !
Then he did the most wicked thing of all .
And it was so .
There were so many things to be done in the house , and she did not know how to do any of them !
And so it went , all day .
There was no sign of anyone having been there .
said the king .
It is always so in life .
One day he thought of a plan .
You brought this upon me .
was the cry .
See !
Do not leave me again .
That was another surprise .
That made a straight line .
Perhaps you have seen it .
This is what he did .
But they were all so happy that it did not matter .
Yes !
Then she looked again .
She ran to the house and found her father .
But remember not to talk !
Look at it !
open !
He was king .
This is it .
said the first .
It was , indeed .
said the bad friend .
She lived with them until she grew up .
Then she married , and had a little baby of her own .
So nobody could get the court built .
He turned round , and there stood a little horse !
No horse was to be found .
No donkey was to be found .
But no donkey was there .
And he put them off .
He knew not what to think .
But I made my face as hard and cruel as the rest , and she turned away , hopeless .
no !
This is the story :
Away , sir , pass on !
Yes , yes !
Who was it ?
I would just waste my time .
Then he went on to another , and this was no better .
Oh , my , no !
He is very old and very wise .
What a silly idea !
Too bad !
Hello !
What was it he saw ?
What do you think ?
For a minute no one said a word .
He wants something going on .
Now here is my plan :
So it was decided to wait .
It was very exciting , the most exciting thing they could remember .
See him go !
What do you think they saw ?
At least some of them had .
It is always that way .
He just had to stand it and do nothing .
And there was no one to help him .
What should he do ?
He did it now .
I need a change .
Yes , Sir , I need a change .
Ha !
I know !
There ought to be a lot of ' em up there .
You know how it is .
And that is just what he did do .
Just then he heard a little noise , as if some one were coming .
Come on !
But it was of no use .
He was very terrible to see .
Yes , indeed , it might have been worse .
Oh dear !
she knows such a very little !
Silence all round , if you please !
-- I proceed .
' Here !
' Oh !
The great question certainly was , what ?
' Well !
There was certainly too much of it in the air .
' Just think of what work it would make with the day and night !
' Ah !
And in she went .
said Five .
said the one who had spoken first .
about once in a minute .
she said , without even looking round .
' Ah , well !
and he went on in these words :
' What !
Would not , could not , would not , could not , would not join the dance .
Would not , could not , would not , could not , could not join the dance .
' No , no !
said the King .
( As that is rather a hard word , I will just explain to you how it was done .
I .
You could see nothing but his eyes , and he seemed to talk with them .
So fat .
Away with the thing !
I mount !
Did you see what it said ?
Never .
Then he did understand it .
Do not be afraid .
If a man must not fight for this , may he fight for anything ?
I would fight for my friend , but if I lost my friend , I should still be there .
But he says he will not .
I got you out , to fight if you want to .
Look here , my man .
But if there is one sight that makes me doubt it it is your foul fat face .
Be still !
I could not understand what it all meant .
And what was to be the end of it all ?
We must fight now .
Now or never .
Come on and fight , I say .
You mean the same yourself .
At last he said :
I cannot understand the thing at all .
They would have killed each other or they would have killed him .
Well now .
And he fell on guard .
They are too fat .
Be quick and quiet .
Are you ?
Come up .
He carried one of the swords .
He !
he !
Yes , I think he looks nice from behind .
The two men took their swords .
For at present you do not understand at all .
At that moment logically I was right .
And at that moment I knew I was wrong .
It was all one thing to me .
Well , let that pass for the moment .
I know their sort , master .
I know ' un .
What they want in England ?
Let me try .
There are only two things that we know for certain about it .
But have you ever seen him ?
What will remain ?
I will tell you .
But as the ordinary man you do like him .
But he did not get out .
But I may be wrong ; there may be a way out .
I think they were afraid of her .
I am sure it is not the best thing to fight .
It would be better to forgive -- if one could really forgive .
I know nothing about when you ought to die .
He did not say it in French .
I must burst up the show ; I must and will say everything .
It looked as if he were wounded ; or , still more , as if he were ill .
he said , at last .
So they do .
You , he - he , are the king .
What do you mean by it , eh ?
You gave it her .
God is not good enough .
It is such a mistake to wait for breakfast .
He says God will be afraid to face him .
You know nothing about us .
he burst out at last .
They saw us get in right enough .
The other did not answer .
You are not God .
he said to himself .
Good lives for bad !
What do you mean ?
He is there .
He said something or nothing .
Hallo !
What can it mean -- meeting all these old people again ?
Have you ever been really there ?
Yes , they are right in a way .
Then he went on :
Now , by God !
They looked up into the eyes of the Master , but looked only for a moment .
He was saying something like this :
The doctors will leave this place ; the keepers will leave this place .
I always leave him lying about .
They had not looked at his face .
When he had passed they looked up .
I will take it on .
Well , I will tell her .
It could not have meant that .
Now for freedom and a blow for it !
I cannot come down to speak to you .
I will try to send him over to you .
I want you to answer him and deal with him .
I cannot : I will not .
God help me , that is why I am speaking !
But the time has come when we that cannot speak must speak .
It is in his hand .
And I will tell you why !
You would say if you found no such house that it was all made up .
But I say no .
Very well .
No ?
I really did .
There was really nothing against the man at all .
He had two sons and one daughter .
How could he have found out ?
He turned suddenly , saying , ` Go back .
The girl was going on with her story .
And he handed it to the man with the nose .
Well , you may say what you like and make it mean what you like .
Shall I tell you ?
If he says something is too terrible to hear , hear it .
And what would our people say then , I should like to know !
His body was never found .
Why , no .
None of which seemed to make much sense .
I know what they think I am .
So do you .
As indeed I found it to be .
You did a fine thing .
Must you be going on ?
He had been run through the body .
At least , at most enemies .
He has never grown up .
He never felt it .
Or something of that kind .
His friend looked at him in some surprise .
But he went further yet .
When it did open it was empty , too .
Hold on !
By whom ?
He was safe .
We will not talk about who was right or wrong in that , but at least there was one point on which we were never wrong , because you were always right .
But from him no cry would come .
She did the bold and the wise thing .
First of all , what is it really all about ?
What is it you object to ?
down !
I can only watch you , knowing what you are ; you can only watch me , knowing what I am .
Come , come !
Ah , how little he knows himself !
But I say that we are the enemies of society , and so much the worse for society .
There I agree .
I am not a man at all .
I will call it a command .
But as for making yourself clear , it is the last thing you do .
And they mean death .
You should really come and see him .
They had never spoken a word .
I will waste no more words .
Now listen to me .
I like you .
Good day .
I must be off .
But it might .
Will there really be no mistake ?
I am afraid of him .
The Doctor did not move .
said the Doctor .
By God !
there was never a man who had to seek long .
There is no time for talk .
But this is what he will do .
You understand ?
It shall go out without you .
he said without taking breath .
by God !
Why should it ?
Then he said --
The town is in arms , as I said it was .
They turned and faced the town .
You did not make it .
You can make nothing .
Let that suffice you .
What did it all mean ?
Who are you ?
What are you ?
Why did you get us all here ?
Do you know who and what we are ?
There was no doubt about it this time .
said the keeper .
I see now what I mean .
The hills do leap -- at least , they try to .
how can I tell you ?
Perhaps it is because you are better than I , and do not know hell .
Do you ask me to forgive him that ?
But it is something like this .
That is not a tree , but the back of a tree .
Not one of them had spoken a word .
I knew how near you were to hell .
But I should like to know .
Then at last he said --
I know what you are all of you , from first to last -- you are the people in power !
mother !
Most haste worst speed .
The lady lived but a very little way off , so that they were soon at her house .
what time !
We are almost afraid to go on .
Have you done ?
What are you about ?
Not another word passed .
said his mother .
He looked up .
It was his own son .
he is not my son .
But at length it was time to explain .
I could not get him to give a second look at them as they passed .
But what is the matter ?
Good night to you .
She went out .
I make all safe to you with my bond .
My mother may get better in that time .
Who told you so ?
What is your head running upon ?
right !
said the old man .
Who knows ?
One by one the ladies dropped off .
was the general cry .
Yes or no !
Will you give it me or not ?
said Sir Arthur .
It would do his old , warm heart good .
O stay !
Why should not he ?
There , now it is straight .
They turned back .
father !
sir !
said she looking up at last .
yes , to be sure .
Why do you all look so ?
She not like to speak !
so much the better for them ; for here are good things enough , and enough for them .
Oh , time enough for that .
Well , then , my watch must go .
Nay , nay !
Is my horse ready there ?
And , dear me !
I shall be left behind .
Never for a moment .
What is the matter , dear mother ?
Yes , enough , and too much for me .
Run !
Is she here , pray , sir ?
Just come .
This is a sight I never thought to see in Old England .
Not I , indeed .
Who are they , pray ?
That is not used to it ; but use is all , they say .
is that all ?
No matter if you did .
ha !
I say nothing , for it is vain to say more .
She may never live to see another such a sight .
Do , miss , speak for me .
She will .
Be yourself , my lord .
Lord .
It is all I can do to forgive this .
Oh , hang it !
I do please .
O yes , yes , we take it ; go on .
The more feet the better it will stand , you know .
I !
Just as much .
hear him !
And I heard him ; and I !
and I !
This goes to my heart !
It is the best I ever heard .
I should never have thought of such a thing .
Oh , not he .
I think I could walk round him .
To be sure you could .
It was the best thing .
said I .
You have the thing at a dead beat .
Where was I ?
I turns .
So lead on , master .
Where am I ?
Do you find yourself better since coming into the air , miss ?
Oh , I shall never be better !
Yes , I suppose so .
Oh , what will become of me ?
What can we do without you ?
You can do very well without me .
And to pay for them .
O , yes .
What a mean animal is this !
We know nothing of him .
My lord , you are coming ?
You had something to say to me , sir ?
But now , to come to the point .
Agh !
Now , look you , my lord .
dance off , then .
Yes , my lord -- yes .
What now ?
I must vote for him .
Oh , yes !
oh yes !
hear ye !
Oh , no matter whom you vote for , my lord , if you are still my friend , and if you know me to be yours .
If you please , my dear .
When I told him she was lost , I thought he would have dropped down .
Yes , there is !
Arthur !
where are you ?
you must all die now .
I say no .
I have never spoken to Arthur , nor he to me , since you bid us not .
Do you hear me , I say , Arthur ?
I never , in the course of all my practice , met with anything better .
He never could see it .
Not I , for one !
come !
The three arrows you shall have .
How do you do ?
the moment he set his foot upon it the foot sank .
I shall like to see .
There could be no doubt .
I tell you my master is not up .
Will .
But let the old man , then , come in here .
Perhaps he can wait a little while .
Old Man .
You are very good , miss ; very good .
But does a small matter make you sigh so ?
What have you lost ?
Just .
What old man ?
Oh , sir , he can wait .
And show the old man in now .
Come forward , if you please .
So , sir , is it you , sir ?
What is all this ?
What is this ?
Silence !
Come forward , sir , and let me hear what you have to say .
Who and what may you be , friend , and what is your business with me ?
You work -- you --
But what ?
again !
Is it so ?
Thank me !
for what , sir ?
Are you sure you had it safe at night ?
All a lie !
all a lie !
Go , go , for the present .
Why !
Oh la !
very good !
Right , right .
No , no , no !
You are all convinced that I told you no lies .
Say no more -- say no more .
And , friend , do you hear ?
indeed !
Now , my dear , what shall I help you to ?
eat !
nothing !
not a bit of fat .
What have you at that corner there , under the cover ?
knowing no better when they married her !
indeed , ladies !
You are quite yourself to - night .
why not ?
One knows him a mile off !
here he is .
where ?
The rest you saw .
I never heard of such a thing !
She did not speak ; but she looked first at one and then at another .
No more !
was now his question .
It was put to the vote .
They had heard of such a thing , but they had only heard of it .
Go !
lost !
We shall be in the dark , man .
yes , to be sure it will .
So I got leave .
is there broken glass ?
Or else --
It would not do .
Though I am shut in here , I have nothing to do with it .
Why not ?
I know how to make use of everything .
friend !
Let down quick !
Why , now we can hold out as long as you please .
How good !
She ran on .
stop !
said everyone , at once running up to her .
was now the question .
Oh , I never can !
will you never come ?
She had heard all that passed , from her window .
It is yours .
I have another vote to give to you .
you cannot refuse it ; I only follow your example .
as my father says .
Arthur , the English servant , was as good as his word .
said his father .
But how is this ?
I know it is ready by this time .
Stay !
Let us do something for him .
But this was not so easily done .
oh , pray , help me !
pray , speak to me !
very well !
very fine !
what shall we all do ?
She had not much to give , but what she had she gave with good - will .
and could not we bring them all to you ?
...
sing .
so near !
How then is this ?
What do they here ?
But look !
Once more .
Tell me that .
I knew no one in the place .
So on I went .
But what is this on the chest ?
what a sight !
And what is it , thought I , after all !
I stood looking at him a moment .
Let me try to explain them .
-- but his only answer was a snore .
Look there !
Not at all .
I am sure that I did not .
But what then ?
What people ?
That was it !
I let them stay .
thought I .
But let us understand each other .
I thought so .
Never say it anywhere .
-- all still .
You see him ?
no time to think about Death then .
Who knows it ?
And much this way it was with me .
How now !
-- was the next order .
But this is not the half ; look again .
A hot old man !
He might as well have kicked me , and done with it .
how ?
says he .
says I at last .
Look sharp , all of ye !
There you have him .
How then ?
To proceed .
Let him go .
A problem ?
Perhaps not .
But this did not last long .
Look ye !
Let it go .
And what is it ?
What is it more ?
why stay ye not when ye come ?
Round with it , round !
O men , you will yet see that -- Ha !
Hand it me .
Well done !
I do not order ye ; ye will it .
No more .
Good night -- good night !
Oh , hard !
I lost this leg .
man has ye there .
I would up heart , were it not like lead .
Oh , God !
Oh , life !
Why so ?
Oh --
and let me call the watch .
At ' em again !
What say ye ?
Stand by all legs !
legs !
O Christ !
Tell me not of it !
heart !
What of that ?
None .
There !
God !
Hold on hard !
never !
Why should this be so ?
Let us try .
Ah , God !
But this is not all .
Very good ; but there is more coming .
....
And I will tell you why .
there !
Pull , will ye ?
They were hidden down there .
Well , well , so be it !
All right !
O Lord , Lord !
Ha , ha !
What shall be said of these ?
But I pass that matter by .
God keep thee !
there again !
But why say more ?
His heart had burst !
You hear ?
How ?
Do ye hear ?
But no more of this .
Oh , man !
O head !
His story was this :
But courage !
take that !
But nothing like this , in the present case , had been done .
Good Lord !
We have thee there .
But how ?
and to what ?
This the creature ?
this he ?
And when ?
But it is not so .
How is that ?
And so it was .
How is this ?
This is what I mean .
But what does he want of them ?
Thou shalt see my back parts , my tail , he seems to say , but my face shall not be seen .
But how now ?
Surely , he will stop for water .
Nay .
My God , men , stand by !
Stand up -- stand up , and stay so !
But not so .
But let us to the story .
who can tell it ?
No ; he did not mean to , at least .
And here let us go back for a moment .
My God !
what is the matter with me ?
Look not too long in the face of the fire , O man !
So be it , then .
So be it , then !
Book !
Now , in what sign will the sun then be ?
But , aside again !
What does he say , with that look of his ?
more and more .
Stand away again and hear him .
How did it get there ?
What should I do without this other arm ?
And he knows it too .
Surely not .
That is all .
But not precisely so .
That is hard which should be soft , and that is soft which should be hard .
Just in time , sir .
good .
Right .
So he must .
Sir ?
There , take the order , and away .
It is , man .
So .
Well , well , well !
What a leg this is !
where go ye now ?
that is the one , sir !
Quick !
So go thy ways , and I will mine .
Forward there !
I would not take it .
Oh , oh !
Oh , cruel !
what hast thou done with her ?
What then ?
What a hold they have , too !
Thank ye .
Um , um , um .
a good sign !
I must see .
But how fair ?
Great God , where art Thou ?
Shall I ?
So , so .
sir , sir !
Oh God !
look down here .
Come !
Let me see .
He goes !
Oh , look , sir !
Do I sing ?
Look at thy bosom !
Here we go again .
Does it go further ?
But no .
I go below ; let me not see that thing here when I return again .
Do to me as you would have me do to you in the like case .
Even now I lose time .
I name no names .
master !
Behold .
Away with me !
let us home !
Away !
no more !
it is done !
See , see !
Stand by , stand by !
So , so , I see him !
Man , man !
They were one man , not thirty .
Surely I have not seen him yet .
What a lovely day again !
To it !
See the sun !
about !
But where ?
my God !
see !
Pull on !
Steady !
oh , oh !
Oh , lonely death on lonely life !
Book I
But see !
That sure was worse .
This would be worse .
whom follow ?
If that way be your walk , you have not far ; So much the nearer danger .
what thou hast said is just and right .
Too much to one !
strange point and new !
What should they do ?
O !
by looks only ?
and what is one ?
What may this mean ?
by the fruit ?
Shall that be shut to Man , which to the Beast Is open ?
then I shall be no more !
How art thou lost !
O miserable of happy !
To which our sire .
But have I now seen Death ?
May we do so ?
Ha ?
What man is that ?
Will you go see the order of the course ?
Not I
I pray you do
Why you were with him , were you not ?
Why for that too
To what effect ?
Good , I will expect you
tell me
Yes , you are .
I will , my Lord .
I know not , Sir
I will , Sir .
' Tis good .
He is welcome too
They are all welcome .
No
That must we also .
Follow me then .
My Lord
I will my Lord .
All .
1 .
An .
Will you stay a - while ?
O most bloody sight !
Where is hee ?
What is your name ?
What is my name ?
As a friend
Pin .
Stand .
Stand
And if not so , how should I wrong a Brother
I am
I say , you are not
All this ?
Is it come to this ?
You did
I did not .
And my heart too
You shall not come to them
Nothing but death shall stay me
How now ?
She is dead
No more I pray you .
No my Lord
Good night my Lord
Good night good Brother
My Lord , I do not know that I did cry
Nothing my Lord
Did we my Lord ?
I : saw you any thing ?
No my Lord , I saw nothing
It shall be done my Lord .
Come , come , the cause .
They are , my Lord
O my Lord
O my heart !
Is not that hee ?
Who will go with me ?
What I , my Lord ?
Not so , my Lord
He
It would be spoke too
Is it not like the King ?
' Tis strange
Do , if it will not stand
King .
So much for him .
Come away .
O God , O God !
My good Lord
Oh where my Lord ?
Who ?
My Lord , the King your Father
The King my Father ?
But where was this ?
Tis very strange
Then saw you not his face ?
no
No more
No more but so
Hold off your hand
I will
My Lord , my Lord .
So be it
Good my Lord tell it
How say you then , would heart of man once think it ?
we will
My Lord , we will not
I will my Lord
I , very well my Lord
But my good Lord
I my Lord , I would know that
Very good my Lord
And then Sir does he this ?
He does : what was I about to say ?
Good my Lord
I shall my Lord
Well , my Lord .
What said he ?
Most welcome home .
But let that go
But what might you think ?
Not that I know
How may we try it further ?
We will try it .
Well , God - a - mercy
Do you know me , my Lord ?
Not I my Lord
How say you by that ?
What is the matter , my Lord ?
No such matter .
What should we say my Lord ?
Why any thing .
To what end my Lord ?
What say you ?
My Lord , we were sent for
No indeed , they are not
I that they do my Lord .
Ha .
This is too long
I my Lord
Good my Lord .
And all for nothing ?
Who does me this ?
We shall my Lord .
There my Lord
At home , my Lord
Farewell
Go , Farewell .
It shall do well .
We will my Lord .
Well my Lord .
Get you a place
No , nor mine .
What is my Lord ?
Nothing
Who I ?
So long ?
Away
Oh , ha ?
The King , sir

You are welcome
Sir , I cannot

My Mother you say

By and by , is easily said .
What can it not ?
Mother , mother , mother
You are my Mother
Oh me , what hast thou done ?
Nay I know not , is it the King ?
As kill a King ?
Oh say

Do you see nothing there ?
Nothing at all , yet all that is I see
I must to England , you know that ?
Good night Mother .
I pray you hast in this .
What noise ?
The body is with the King , but the King is not with the body .
A thing my Lord ?
But where is he ?
Bring in my Lord .
Where ?
For England ?
Good

For .

But not by him
Who shall stay you ?
Will you know them then

The very same
Why out of this , my Lord ?

Why he had none
Go too

For none neither
How long is that since ?

Why he , more then another ?

And smelt so ?
Must there no more be done ?
Away thy hand

Get thee to bed .
When ?
Now
This is a sorry sight
Not yet
Oh , by whom ?
So all
Old man .
Why see you not ?
Farewell , Father
I , my good Lord
My Lord , I will not
I did so : And went further , which is now Our point of second meeting .
' Tis hee
My Lord his throat is cut , that I did for him
What , my good Lord ?
Are you a man ?
What is the night ?
Did you send to him Sir ?
But one word more
- A fourth ?
is this so ?
1 I Sir , all this is so .
Where are they ?
Come in , without there .
No indeed my Lord
Come bring me where they are .
Why should I Mother ?
I , that he was
Who must hang them ?
What should he be ?
I know him now .
Sir , Amen
Why well
Well too
Did you say All ?
All ?
You see her eyes are open
I , but their sense are shut
Oh , oh , oh
What a sigh is there ?
Well , well , well
To bed , to bed , to bed .
Will she go now to bed ?
Good night good Doctor .
We doubt it nothing
It shall be done
It is the cry of women , my good Lord
Well , say sir
What is thy name ?
Then he is dead ?
To thee old cause !
And why should I not speak to you ?
how real !
masses !
8 What are you doing young man ?
The side by side !
O death !
O you and me at last , and us two only .
I do not know what it is any more than he .
What do you think has become of the young and old men ?
Where are you off to , lady ?
what am I ?
what are you ?
Why should I pray ?
it shall be you !
what are you doing ?
look to your arms !
enough !
Stand back !
come forward !
The mountains ?
Earth !
and what is life ?
Perhaps I might tell more .
Who wishes to walk with me ?
O you and I !
what is it to us what the rest do or think ?
What is all else to us ?
Do you suppose you have a right to a good sight , and he or she has no right to a sight ?
To be lost if it must be so !
Why can you not continue ?
O bride !
What climes ?
who are the married women ?
You daughter or son of England !
you working - woman too !
yet take warning !
they go !
or man or woman come forth !
yourself ?
I see you face to face !
Who was to know what should come home to me ?
We understand then do we not ?
How it is I know not -- yet behold !
To be indeed a God !
what can it do now ?
and thou for them !
Our freedom all in thee !
our very lives in thee !
Why what have you thought of yourself ?
Is it you then that thought yourself less ?
Or the rich better off than you ?
O to die advancing on !
O mate for me !
( Who are you ?
Two together !
blow !
O night !
loud !
land !
O land !
O throat !
But soft !
Here I am !
here !
O in vain !
O happy life !
But my mate no more , no more with me !
We two together no more .
or is it really to me ?
O give me the clue !
They live in other young men O kings !
Is the house shut ?
is the master away ?
O me !
O life !
beat !
And what does it say to me all the while ?
O such for me !
What I have I also give you .
or by arms ?
My sacred one , my mother .
dear father !
little and big ?
( Mother !
behold it well !
Did we think victory great ?
O help !
and what is this in it and from it ?
O if one could but fly like a bird !
is it through you ?
You !
the flesh over and over !
What do I know of life ?
And these things I see suddenly , what mean they ?
Is to - day nothing ?
yourself , for ever and ever !
O living always , always dying !
my special word to thee .
Well , you cannot trick me .
Behold a woman !
good and evil !
O all dear to me !
or in the spirit of man ?
O setting sun !
And what are those of life but for Death ?
you power that does this work !
what clue to all in you ?
And who art thou ?
compared indeed to that !
continue on the same !
Thou !
thou !
How dare one say it ?
