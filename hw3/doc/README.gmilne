For this assignment our group did a lot of pair programming to implement the baseline. 
However, after our final pair programming session we were still not producing the results we need. 
The group implemented the perceptron algorithm together but the update_feature function was still not working properly. 

I wrote the first working update_feature function which produced valuable results. 
However it did not take into account the special feature ‘B’ but the function updated the other 19 features. 
Once Wenhao wrote the ‘B’ feature update, I began testing the algorithm. Additionally, I also proof read and edited the documentation.
